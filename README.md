# dropdown-responsive-flexbox-nav
This is a Navbar that utilizes flexbox. The dropdown menus are displayed 
using the "checkbox trick", which eliminates the need for javascript.

<p>
  I've spent many hours trying to code a generic "business website" navbar that is lightweight and easily customizable. I hope
  this helps out anyone else who needs such a navbar.
